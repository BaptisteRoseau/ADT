# Stack

## Theorical principle
A stack is a *Last In First Out* (LIFO) structure.
It is best described in it's [Wikipedia's Stack page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).

It's main functions are:
- is_empty()
- push()
- peek()
- pop()

## Implementation


# Queue

## Theorical principle
A queue is a *First In First Out* (FIFO) structure.
It is best described in it's [Wikipedia's Queue page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)).

It's main functions are:
- is_empty()
- enqueue()
- front()
- dequeue()
- pop()


## Implementation



# Dequeue

## Theorical principle
A Double-Ended Queue (Dequeue) is similar to a Queue, but objects can be added and removed both from the front and the back of it.
It is best described in it's [Wikipedia's Double-Ended Queue page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue).

It's main functions are:
- is_empty();
- front()
- back()
- push_front()
- push_back()
- pop_front()
- pop_back()
- remove_front()
- remove_back()


## Implementation



# Set

## Theorical principle

It's main functions are:
- is_empty()
- length()
- add()
- remove()
- is_in()
- retrieve()
- get_umpteenth()


## Implementation



# Binary Search Tree

## Theorical principle

It is best described in it's [Wikipedia's Binary Search Tree page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree).

It's main functions are:
- is_empty()
- length()
- add()
- remove()
- is_in()
- retrieve()
